# Test driver for upgrading a Greenplum cluster with pg_upgrade. For test data,
# this script assumes the gpdemo cluster in gpAux/gpdemo/datadirs contains the
# end-state of an ICW test run. Performs a pg_dumpall, initializes a parallel
# gpdemo cluster and upgrades it against the ICW cluster and then performs
# another pg_dumpall. If the two dumps match then the upgrade created a new
# identical copy of the cluster.
